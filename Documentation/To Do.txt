• Complete sample run document (.m file) which does a session from start to end.
• move previously written comment file about stimulus examples into this document
• should consist of lines of runnable code, interspersed with comments
> The runnable code part of this has been completed: See RSM_Batch.m
The interspersed comments are not yet sufficient. BV should expand these comments. 


• Document all system set-up issues (ie system configuration and hardware) that are not directly related to stimulus specification. Including hardware pinouts for 6501 and breakout cable.  Step by step.
> This is partially completed: See Cable.jpg; Calibration.txt and Setup.rtf. 
The latter two documents should be expanded and unified by BV. 




• Further documentation of timing and performance characteristics as necessary
> We need to decide what our first key tests should be. 



> Would be useful to at least document what's already known - what configurations work (roughly is better than nothing)
> also document what hardware/software combos have been tested



• Figure out what is causing the issue that triggers from DAQ to stimulus computer cannot be seen by 6501. (Field Lab)
> Bill and Greg need to talk to clarify status of issue. 


• Add ability to override default movie path. 
> Status uncertain. BV needs to check.  

• Improve testing of monitor setup util. Current testing isn’t sufficient.

> Testing and functionality have been improved. I believe it has been successfully used by Greg and Xiaoyang for calibration of one of their monitors. I need to confirm this with Greg. Several utility methods need to be completed for monitor object class.  

• Figure out how to mirror a subset of displays in OS X. (VGA "splitter"?)

> No work yet undertaken. 

• Gamma calibration code: add a mode which shows steps above and below “gray”?
> No work yet undertaken.



• Finish arbitrary noise distribution class.

> The current Random_Noise_CDF_LUT object class provides the infrastructure that we want. What is missing is a way for the user to pass in a user defined cumulative distribution function. 


• Document how to recover from a crash of the standalone DigIO process. Try to document other “crash recovery” issues.

> BV needs to complete a document describing the crash recovery process that was used previously. 



• Leave RSM in proper screen mode after gratings.
> May already be resolved. Needs examination / testing by BV. 


• Test s-file handling of pulse stimuli.


• Improve s-file specification (current method is clunky).


• Add "trigger_interval" functionality to classes (ie number of frames between output pulses). 
        - defaults to one pulse every 100 frames
        - over-rideable to different number frames
        - set to 0 to allow none. 


•  Improve missed frame detection in the case of repeat stim. (Consider 5 stimuli back-to-back. We don't want to stop in between stimuli to look for missed frame, instead we want to examine the timestamps for all 5 stimulus runs once they are done). 
> Status uncertain. BV needs to check. 







RESOLVED OR COMPLETED ITEMS BELOW. 

• Continue “black screen mystery debug”; is it the version of java that matlab uses?
> Note: Required updating version of MGL to deal with the fact that Mac changed one of its graphics library routines. 

• bundled up version for testing
> Completed: Current maintained version resides here in drop-box. 

• Get rid of unused files.
> Completed.  

• Clean out cruft / obsolete / commented-out code from within m-files. 
> Completed. 

• Test code performance to look for breakage.
> Completed. 

• Combine "Flashing Squares" stimulus class with "Pulse" stimulus class.
> Completed.

• Try to solve "every-other time problem" observed on wheel in starting the intra-process communication with the DigIO utilities.
> Completed. 

• Try another monitor from Salk graveyard.
> No longer applicable. This was part of black screen bug fix attempts. 

• Write monitor setup utility.
> Completed. 

• Change ALL time units to frames in all stimulus classes.
> Completed. 

• Modify so that user can easily pass in x&y start&end info for sync pulses.
Completed. 

• Comment out all n_repeats code so it doesn't work but could be resurrected.
> Completed. 

• Eliminate instances of implicit variables (load ... "obj").
> Completed. 

• Concentrate all hardcoded globals and paths in one place.
> Completed. 

• Warning and clip for rgb values outside range.  All stimulus classes.  Checking and warning should occur before dropping into C code that will use it.
> Completed. 

• Add size control to focus squares.
> Completed.

• Change sigma for Gaussian into units of grayscale (e.g. sigma 0.16 means that 3 sigmas just bumps into the gamut, which is ±0.5 ).
> Completed. 

• Make silent movie pre-run more self-contained (ie no movie needed in Movie_Vault).
> Completed. 

• Implement a wait_trigger() and send_trigger() functions from command line.
> Completed. 

•  Pull out old code for matlab RNG.

> Completed.
