\f0\fs24 \cf0 RSM_Change_Log.doc listed all changes I made to Bill\'92s code. \
\
For some of them, I only referred the line number of core code. For detailed comparison of these two versions, please see .doc files in folder \'91diff_checker\'92. In each of these files, left is the original code and right is the changed code. Red marks the deleted code and green marks added code. These are generated by a website: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.diffchecker.com/"}}{\fldrslt https://www.diffchecker.com/}}}
