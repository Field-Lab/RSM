The goal is to generate a suitable “Monitor_Obj” which is a matlab data structure of the object type. RSM uses this structure to control things like the gamma tables. 


Here is an example of such object:


Monitor_Obj with properties:
            monitor_name: 'RigA_CRT1'
            num_lut_bits: 8
            gamma_model: @BrainardModel
            optometer_raw_data: [153x4 double]
            red_table: [1x256 double]
            green_table: [1x256 double]
            blue_table: [1x256 double]
            red_params: [2.5200 32 3.2181]
            green_params: [2.5200 32 3.1320]
            blue_params: [2.5200 32 3.1645]
            gamma_test_date: '09-Jan-2014'
            width: 640
            physical_width: 28.5000
            height: 480
            physical_height: 21.5000
            screen_refresh_freq: 119.5175
            cen_width: 320
            cen_height: 240
            default_mondesc_path: './RSM_Monitors/'
            mon_num: 2
            backgrndcolor: [0.5000 0.5000 0.5000] 


Step 0: Fix a potential bug


Open Monitor_Obj.m (which lives in RSM_Classes). 
In line 56 “function[obj] = Monitor_Obj_New( varargin )” should be “function[obj] = Monitor_Obj( varargin ).” All you have to do is remove “_New”.


Step 1: Set up basic information 


* Set your matlab path to include the RSM home directory with subdirectories.
* Navigate your matlab working directory to the RSM_Monitors directory.
* At the matlab command prompt: "new_display = Configure_Display". You should see the following menu:
           ****************************************
*  RSM Monitor Configuration Utility.  *
****************************************
Options: 
[ 1]         Create new monitor object. 
[ 2]         Load existing monitor object. 
[ 3]         Edit existing monitor object. 
[ 4]         Collect data for new gamma profile. 
[ 5]         Visualize gamma profile. (doesn’t yet work)
[ 6]         Remake gamma tables using best-fit gamma parameters. 
[ 7]         Remake gamma tables using values interpolated from data. 
[ 8]         Test existing gamma profile linearity. 
[ 9]         Determine frame refresh frequency. 
[10]         Save new monitor object. 
[11]         Exit. 


Enter number of option:


* Choose 1 to initialize. You’ll be asked to fill in some basic information about the display including:
   * Human name of monitor (remember to use single quotation mark)
   * Width of stimulus display screen [pixels]
   * Width of stimulus display screen [pixels]
   * Physical width of stimulus display screen [cm]
   * Height of stimulus display screen [pixels]
   * Physical height of stimulus display screen [cm]
   * Vertical refresh frequency of stimulus display screen [Hz] (round numbers are fine)
   * Number of bits in LUT [bits]: 
* If you want to change any of these information, choose 3 in the main menu and choose whatever you want to change in the submenu. Also you can add the following information:
   * Default monitor description path. (should be answered with './RSM_Monitors/‘)
   * Monitor location number. 
   * Monitor default background color.
* Save the object by choosing 10 in the main menu.
* Choose 9 to empirically adjust the frame rate to high precision. Here the refresh frequency will be calculated in real-time. You will be asked to input the data collection time.
* Save


Step 2: Gamma calibration
* Choose 4 to collect data for gamma profile
   * You will be prompted with questions specific for a “Graseby 350 Linear/Log Optometer”. If this is the optometer model you are using, please check the setting as those questions instruct. If not, just choose 1 for all these questions.
   * Enter the power readings of optometer as data collection starts. At the end of each round, you can choose to collect another repetition or stop.
   * Once you have collected data the program will generate default gamma tables via matlab’s interpolation functions. The interpolated gamma tables can be changed to values based on a best fit of a classic gamma function model (Brainards). This is done by using option “6” in main menu (and can be set back to the interpolated value by option “7”).
* Save
* Choose 8 to test linearity of gamma calibrations. This part is mostly same with 4.
* Save
* Choose 11 to exit.
